### Hi there 👋

My name is **Pascal**, and I am a long-time, huge Laravel enthusiast! I create [open-source packages](https://github.com/protonemedia) (with over 5.5M downloads), run a [blog](https://pascalbaljet.dev), stream on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIttNYcazftklfmopuKgHnA), I've recorded a [Laracasts Course](https://laracasts.com/series/crafting-vue-modals) and you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pascalbaljet), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pascalbaljet.bsky.social), and a bunch of [other platforms](https://pinkary.com/@pascalbaljet) 🙌

Besides Laravel, I am interested in Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vue.js. Recently, I started working on [**Inertia UI**](https://inertiaui.com/inertia-table?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=pascalbaljet-readme), a collection of premium components that helps you build modern web applications, specifically designed for Laravel and Inertia.js.

Here are some of my favorite packages that I've worked on:

* 📽️ [**Laravel FFMpeg**](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-ffmpeg) - This package integrates with Laravel's Filesystem, configuration system, and logging handling. It supports filters, (encrypted) HLS, concatenation, multiple inputs/outputs, image sequences (timelapse), complex filters and mapping, frame/thumbnail exports, watermarks, creating a mosaic/sprite/tile from a video, and generating VTT Preview Thumbnail files.
* 🔎 [**Laravel Cross Eloquent Search**](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-cross-eloquent-search) - This package allows you to search through multiple Eloquent models (in-database). It supports sorting, pagination, scoped queries, eager loading relationships, and searching through single or multiple columns.
* 🛡️ [**Laravel XSS Protection**](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-xss-protection) - This is a Laravel Middleware that protects your app against Cross-site scripting (XSS). It sanitizes request input, and it can sanitize Blade echo statements.
* 🖼️ [**Inertia Modal**](https://github.com/inertiaui/modal) - With Inertia Modal, you can easily open any route in a Modal or Slideover without having to change anything about your existing routes or controllers.
