### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pascal. I run a company called [Protone Media](https://protone.media), which is based in The Netherlands, and we love working with Laravel, VueJS, and Tailwind CSS.

Besides the Laravel ecosystem, I've also worked on Android/iOS apps, React Native, Angular, Java, and C++ applications. I run a [blog](https://protone.media/blog) about Laravel, PHP, and other development topics, and you can find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pascalbaljet) as well! ðŸ™Œ

I maintain several Laravel packages, which you can find at [my company's organization](https://github.com/protonemedia). Here are some of my favorites:

* [Laravel FFMpeg](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-ffmpeg) - This package provides an integration with FFmpeg for Laravel. The storage of the files is handled by Laravel's Filesystem.
* [Laravel Paddle](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-paddle) - Paddle.com API integration for Laravel with support for webhooks/events.
* [Laravel Analytics Event Tracking](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-analytics-event-tracking) - Package to easily send events to Google Analytics.
* [Laravel Cross Eloquent Search](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-cross-eloquent-search) - Package to search through multiple Eloquent models.
* [Laravel Form Components](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-form-components) - Blade components to rapidly build forms with Tailwind CSS Custom Forms and Bootstrap 4. Supports validation, model binding, default values, translations, includes default vendor styling and fully customizable!
* [Laravel Verify New Email](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-verify-new-email) - This package adds support for verifying new email addresses: when a user updates its email address, it won't replace the old one until the new one is verified.

Want to support the development of these packages? Consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/pascalbaljet)! ðŸš€
