### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Pascal**, and I'm a long-time, huge Laravel enthusiast! I create [packages](https://github.com/protonemedia) (with over 1.5M downloads), run a [blog](https://protone.media/blog), stream on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIttNYcazftklfmopuKgHnA), and you can find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pascalbaljet) ðŸ™Œ

Recently I started a new project called [**Laravel Splade**](https://splade.dev), which provides a super easy way to build *Single Page Applications* (SPA) using standard Laravel Blade templates, enhanced with renderless Vue 3 components. In essence, you can write your app using the simplicity of Blade, and besides that magic SPA-feeling, you can sparkle it to make it interactive. All without ever leaving Blade.

Besides Laravel, I'm interested in Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vue.js. You can find my open-source packages [right here](https://github.com/protonemedia). Here are some of my favorites:

* [**Laravel Splade**](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-splade) - The magic of Inertia.js with the simplicity of Blade.
* [**Laravel FFMpeg**](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-ffmpeg) -  Integrates with Laravel's Filesystem, configuration system and logging handling. Support for filters, (encrypted) HLS, concatenation, multiple inputs/outputs, image sequences (timelapse), complex filters and mapping, frame/thumbnail exports, watermarks, creating a mosaic/sprite/tile from a video, and generating VTT Preview Thumbnail files.
* [**Laravel Cross Eloquent Search**](https://github.com/protonemedia/laravel-cross-eloquent-search) - A package to search through multiple Eloquent models (in-database). It supports sorting, pagination, scoped queries, eager load relationships, and searching through single or multiple columns.
* [**Inertia.js Tables for Laravel Query Builder**](https://github.com/protonemedia/inertiajs-tables-laravel-query-builder) - A DataTables-like experience for Inertia.js with support for searching, filtering, sorting, toggling columns, and pagination.
